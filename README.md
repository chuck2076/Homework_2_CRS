## My Portfolio
Create a Portfolio Landing Page that showcases my work to a potential employer

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
## Acceptance Criteria Met

1. I created a page with my name, recent photo and links to About Me, My Work and Contact Info

2. I created a smooth scrolling navigation in the links to the corresponding sections

3. I created titled images linking to applications I haven't developed yet

4. The first application is larger in size than the other applications and duplicates the .png we were to use as a reference guide

5. When clicking on the links, the user is taken to applications I haven't developed yet

6. When the user re-sizes the page on different screens and devices, the header is responsive but the body isn't because I just couldn't figure it out

7. Overall, the application resembles the mock-up functionality provided in the homework instructions
